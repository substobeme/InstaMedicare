**InstaMediHelp** is an intelligent healthcare support system designed to provide drug recommendations based on patient-reported symptoms. The system leverages advanced machine learning techniques, including **BERT embeddings**, to interpret textual symptom descriptions and generate accurate suggestions. The platform combines a **Streamlit frontend** for intuitive user interaction with a **FastAPI backend** that processes requests, logs recommendations, and sends prescription summaries via email.

## Features

- **Customer Mode:**  
  Users can enter personal information and describe their symptoms. The system analyzes the input using BERT-based embeddings and recommends the most suitable drugs.

- **Admin Mode:**  
  Administrators have access to a full log of all prescriptions, enabling monitoring and analysis of drug recommendations over time. Each entry includes timestamps and patient details.

- **Machine Learning Model:**  
  The recommendation engine employs pre-trained **BERT embeddings** to capture the semantic meaning of patient symptoms. An XGBoost classifier then predicts the top `k` drug options, ensuring reliable and context-aware suggestions.

- **Automatic Email Notifications:**  
  Once a prescription is generated, the systemâ€™s agent automatically sends an email containing patient details (name, age, receipt ID, symptoms) and the recommended drugs. This ensures timely communication while keeping the workflow automated and agentic.
